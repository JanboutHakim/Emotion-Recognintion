# Real-Time Facial Emotion Recognition System  
**Computer Vision + Deep Learning + Real-Time Application**

This project implements a **real-time facial emotion recognition** system capable of identifying **seven emotional states** from live video or still images.  
It combines **facial detection, head pose estimation, image preprocessing, deep learning classification**, and a **desktop application interface**.

### Recognized Emotions:
Happiness ‚Ä¢ Sadness ‚Ä¢ Anger ‚Ä¢ Fear ‚Ä¢ Disgust ‚Ä¢ Surprise ‚Ä¢ Neutral

## ‚ú® Key Features
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Real-Time Detection** | Classifies emotions from live webcam feed with low latency |
| **Head Pose Estimation** | Detects face orientation to improve recognition robustness |
| **Custom CNN Model** | ~2.28M parameters, optimized for performance & generalization |
| **Dataset Fusion** | Combined samples from multiple datasets to increase diversity |
| **Data Augmentation Pipeline** | Rotation, brightness normalization, structural preservation |
| **Desktop Application** | Built using Tkinter + OpenCV, no browser required |

## üß† System Architecture

---

## üóÇ Dataset
This project merges and processes samples from:

- **FER-Plus**
- **RAF-DB**

### Dataset Processing:
- Removed images without valid detected faces
- Converted all images to **grayscale**
- Resized to **224√ó224**
- Balanced & expanded classes using augmentation

---

## üß¨ Data Preprocessing & Augmentation
To improve generalization and deal with class imbalance:

- Horizontal Flip
- Controlled Angle Rotations
- Morphological Closing to maintain structure
- Brightness Normalization based on median luminance

These steps helped the model perform reliably in **real-world lighting and pose variations**.

---

## üèó Model Architecture (CNN)
- Depthwise-Separable Convolutions (MobileNet-inspired)
- ~**2.28 million** trainable parameters
- Softmax output for 7 emotion classes
- Designed for **real-time inference** on CPU

Model: "sequential"
